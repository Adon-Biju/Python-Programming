# Computational Problem Solving (Making a coin game)
For task 1 we were provided with a set of function specifications, which
contains a series of incomplete function definitions and some instructions and a tester program, along with 
a test plan for the functions. Solutions to this can be found in task1.py

For task 2 we were provided with a set of specifications for the class coin_game (the coin game was a game we were trying to create) in Python using pre-defined classes.
